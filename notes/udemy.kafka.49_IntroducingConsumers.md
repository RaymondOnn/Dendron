In the earlier section, we learned a lot about bringing data into your Kafka.

We learned almost every aspect of Apache Kafka producer and created a bunch of producer examples.

Kafka producers are a critical part of the streaming applications because these producers are responsible

for originating the data streams and bringing them into your Kafka cluster.

Once your stream starts flowing into Kafka you are ready to tap into these extremes and plug in your

stream processing applications.

There are many ways to create a rich stream processing applications.

Kafka offers you 3 tools for that purpose. Consumer APIs,

Kafka streams library, and KSQL. You can use Kafka consumer APIs to consume data from your Kafka

brokers and create your stream processing applications.

And that's what we are going to learn in this section.

Kafka streams and KSQL are beyond the scope of this beginner's course.

These things would require separate training in itself and I have an independent course for a real-time

stream processing using Kafka streams.

Great!

So let's start creating Kafka consumers from the next lecture.

Keep learning and keep growing.
