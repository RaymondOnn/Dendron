We have covered quite a few ways of managing documents so far.

The last one we have yet to cover, is to delete documents.

You probably won't be surprised to hear that this is also super easy.

In fact, you can probably guess how to do it.

On your screen, you can see the query to retrieve a document, which you have seen quite a few

times by now.

To remove the document instead of retrieving it, we simply change the HTTP verb to "DELETE."

As you can see, things are often quite intuitive due to the REST API.

Let's run the query to delete the document.

The document has now been deleted, and we should no longer be able to retrieve it.

And indeed, the document is no longer found.

As with updating documents, it is also possible to delete documents that match a given query,

but we will look at that a bit later.
