Value chain.

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to explain why organizations build APIs, and you should

also be able to describe what is needed to build successful APIs.

Let's start with the question What is an APIs?

Value proposition?

An API makes the asset of value easily accessible within and outside the bounds of the organization.

Let me explain what I mean by this.

Let's say an organization holds some data which is of value to some entities who are within and outside

the organization.

Unless this data can be easily accessed by these entities, they will not be able to reap the value

offered by these assets.

And so an API makes it easy for the assets of value to be accessed by the entities who have interest

in those assets.

I like to categorize these assets in three categories.

The first one is the data and integration category, for example, where the company holds a lot of

data for weather across the globe and they make this data available by way of APIs.

Fedex tracks millions of packages shipped by the individuals and businesses.

This information is made available by Fedex by way of APIs, service and products.

In this category, there is a big boom.

There are a lot of enterprises that are building products and services that they are making available

by way of APIs.

Think of Netflix, the movies they have and the TV shows they have are their assets, and they're exposing

these assets by way of APIs.

And then TV manufacturers like Sony and Samsung are using these APIs to easily access these TV shows

and the movies.

Twilio has built an infrastructure backbone for communication on the Internet, and they expose their

communication capabilities, such as SMS, video calls, voice calls by way of APIs.

And then these APIs are used by many application developers to expose these communication features such

as SMS in their applications.

The third category is the Social network data.

This does not need a lot of explanation.

Facebook and Twitter have millions of users, and these millions of users are generating terabytes of

data every single day.

This data is owned by Facebook and Twitter, and there are businesses and individuals who are very interested

in getting access to this data.

API makes it easy for these social networks to expose the data which is of value to these outside entities

such as businesses and application developers.

Now a big question Why would any organization want to make the asset of value that they own easily accessible?

In other words, what is in it for the owner of the asset?

So let's talk about the business benefits of exposing an asset by way of APIs.

The business benefits may be put under two broad categories.

The direct revenue model is the one in which the owner organization creates a new revenue stream by

way of exposing their data or services via APIs.

And Twilio have technology capabilities that they offer to their customer.

The weather company has the weather data that they offer to their customer by way of a subscription

model.

The idea is that outside entities who are accessing these assets pay for their use.

The second category is the indirect benefits.

The idea here is that the company is not making any direct revenue by exposing their assets by way of

APIs.

But there are other benefits which obviously at the end of the day somehow has a positive impact on

the revenue for that company.

For example, eBay, Fedex and indeed all of these businesses expose APIs, but they don't charge for

the use of their APIs.

Each of these organizations have a different reason why they are exposing these APIs.

For example, eBay may be doing it because they want to expand their partner ecosystem.

Fedex may be looking at the competitive advantage of exposing APIs, indeed may be looking for brand

recognition.

At this point, I suggest that you take a pause and think about the assets in your organization and

what can be the business benefit of exposing those assets to the outside entities.

The end consumer of the assets may be put in two buckets.

The first one is the individual users.

These are the public domain users who use applications built for browsers or applications that these

users download from the app stores such as Google Play.

These applications add value on top of the assets exposed by the organization's enterprise Users are

the users who are mostly involved in.

Carrying out business functions by using SaaS solutions or packaged solutions or homegrown applications

that add value on top of the assets exposed by the organizations via APIs.

Let's go over the visual representation of what I have covered so far.

An organization has an asset which can be data service or a product which is desired by the end consumer.

Applications are used for delivering the value added asset to the end consumer.

The organization owning the asset makes the asset easily accessible to the applications by way of APIs.

Whether the asset will provide value to the end consumer or not will depend on how the application developers

are using these APIs.

The most important part from the app development perspective is that the application developer must

understand the end customer's needs and build applications that give value and delightful experience

to the end consumers.

Not only that, these application developers also play an important role in enhancing the value of these

APIs or the assets offered by the organization by providing them helpful feedback.

Last but not the least, the API development.

Here the API developer uses the raw material, which is the asset or the service or the product of the

organization and create a product which is the API.

Now from the API developer's perspective, their customer is the app developer, but it is important

to ensure that they also understand their customer's customer.

Who is the end user of the value offered by their organization.

The API developer should understand the needs of the app developers as well and help the app developer

in every possible manner to ensure that they are able to create applications that will provide the value

to the end consumer.

Now one important point to note is that having an asset exposed by way of API does not guarantee that

API will be well received by the application developers to build APIs which will be attractive to the

app developers.

The API developer or designer must ensure that all of the rest API design principles are followed.

The API developer must follow the best practices and guidelines for building rest APIs.

In addition to that, it is important for the API developer to use the right tools and technologies.

The developer must have the skills and the knowledge needed for building these rest APIs.

My objective for this course is that by the end of this course, you as the API designer will have a

thorough understanding of the API value chain.

You will have a strong foundation in terms of understanding of the rest API design principles and you

will be able to apply the best practices and guidelines that you will learn in this course.

I will be covering some of the tools and technologies, but in this course it will not be possible for

me to cover all tools and technologies used for building rest APIs.

So my suggestion is that as you are progressing through the course, do your own research, pick up

the tools, try those out and make your own opinion on which tools or technologies you like the most.

From skills and knowledge perspective, I'll help you get up to speed with building appropriate skills

and knowledge required for designing rest APIs.

But skills and knowledge is something that you will need to continue to develop even after finishing

this course.

Before I end this lecture, I would like to leave you with some questions.

Why would your organization build an API?

Think about any asset that your organization holds which may be exposed by way of API.

Is there some data?

Is there some service?

Are there any capabilities that your organization has?

If your answer is yes, then who will get the most benefit from these assets?

Is it going to be the internal stakeholders or is it going to be some external entity or is it going

to be partners?

If your organization decides to go forward with the APIs for external entities, what will be the business

value?

In other words, what is in it for your organization?

If it exposes these assets by way of APIs?

And last question are there partners?

Are there entities who will help in delivering the value?

In other words, do you think there is a way by which you can create an ecosystem around your APIs?

So here is the thing Answer these questions and post your responses to the Q&A forum.

For this lecture, let's have a discussion.
