## What is GitHub Actions

- Platform to automate development workflows
- When something happens in/to your repo, automated actions are executed in response 
- **Events**: changes in/to the repo e.g. PR created, contributor joined, issued created, PR merged

## Automating the process
1. Listen for events
2. Trigger workflows

## Why GitHub Actions?
- if repo is in GitHub, use same tool instead of third party integration
- setting up the CI/CD pipeline is easy
    - integration with other technologies
