Welcome back.

In the earlier section, we learned a lot about the Kafka broker Kafka cluster and the Kafka architecture.

All that was great. However, sending data streams to Kafka is your first step for using Apache Kafka.

Hence we dedicate one full section for sending data to Kafka using Kafka producer API.

So let's start.

Kafka producer API is primarily made available in Java.

In this course, we will be using Java APIs.

However the API is are also available in other languages and all those language bindings follow the

same structure as Java APIs.

Some of the most commonly used language libraries are listed here.

There are many other language bindings that are implemented by open source community. But except for

Java API all the above language APIs are based on the Kafka client library named librdkafka.

You can find documentation and an exhaustive list of supported languages at following URL. Great!

See you again.

Keep learning and Keep Growing.
