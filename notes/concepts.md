Data Quality
- Problems: As smaller teams are tackling bigger data, data quality slips through the cracks
- Pitfalls
  - Lack of documentation
  - Scaling with people, not technology
  - Data quality rules changes over time
  - Solutions can only be used by engineers
  - Few checks are easy, but scaling it is difficult
  - Tedious process implementing effective thresholds
  - Difficulty in check involving custom logic
- Solution:
  1. Operational Quality: Freshness, nulls, blanks, outliers
  2. Logic Quality: Business-specific logic, assumptions and requirements
  3. Application Quality: Right data, used the right way, for the right task
