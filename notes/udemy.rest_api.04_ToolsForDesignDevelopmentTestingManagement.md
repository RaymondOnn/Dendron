In this lecture, I'll briefly go over the tools and platforms that I have used for demos and samples

in this course.

In order to complete this course, you do not need to know any of these tools as I'll go through the

course and as I pick up these tools for different demos and samples, I'll explain to you what they

offer and we'll give you enough knowledge to carry out simple tasks with these tools.

You can use any modern language to implement rest APIs.

I decided to go with NodeJS for all my samples in this course because it is simple and there are many

packages available to extend the functionality of NodeJS based APIs.

There are multiple rest API frameworks on Node.

I'll be using the Express framework, which is the most popular framework for implementing node based

rest APIs for demos and code walkthroughs.

I'll be using the ID Visual Studio code, which is the free version of Visual Studio available from

Microsoft.

There are many tools for testing rest APIs.

I decided to go with Postman.

It's available as a free Google Chrome plugin.

For the samples.

I'm using MongoDB and I'm using the hosted instance of MongoDB.

Instead of creating a local instance of MongoDB, the host is instance will be on MLB.com.

In the next lecture, I'll show you how to create Mongo database on MLB.com for creating the Swagger

specifications.

I'll use the online editor for Swagger and the NPM package for deploying a local Swagger editor in the

section on API management, I will be showing you demos of various features available on the API management

platform.

For that I'll be using IBM API, Connect, MuleSoft and Apigee.

Please note that the samples in this course were originally created using the hosted instance of MongoDB

on MLB.com and recently MLB.com has been acquired by MongoDB.

So going forward, what you need to do is create an instance of MongoDB on the MongoDB cloud.

You will learn about how to do this in the next lecture.
