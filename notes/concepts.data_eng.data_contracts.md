### Data Quality Dimensions


#### Accuracy
Accuracy in data quality refers to the degree to which data correctly describes the “real world” object or event being described. For data to be accurate, it must be correct and free from errors.

#### Validity
Validity in data quality refers to the extent to which the data conforms to defined business rules or constraints. Valid data helps to ensure that the data aligns with the expected format and value ranges, which is crucial for subsequent data processing and analysis.


#### Uniqueness
Uniqueness in the context of data quality refers to the requirement that a data value should be represented only once in a dataset. This is especially important when dealing with identifiers, where duplication might result in incorrect data mapping or aggregation.

#### Completeness
Completeness in data quality refers to the requirement that a particular set of data should be comprehensive, all-inclusive, and contain all the necessary elements. In the context of a dataset, this implies that all the expected data values should be present without any omissions.

#### Consistency
Ensuring consistency in our dataset is an essential aspect of maintaining high data quality. Consistency means that the data across the entire dataset follows a specific format, range, or pattern, providing reliable and predictable data for analysis.
