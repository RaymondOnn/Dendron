Hello and welcome to this session.

Under POSIX standards, regular expressions are divided into 2 sets - The basic set and the

extended set. In this module, we will look at the basic set alone.

We will cover the extended set in the next module.

The basic set comes with a set of symbols, each one having a specific meaning and interpretation.

We will take these symbols one by one,

and see examples,

and hands-on sessions to study each of them thoroughly.

We have already seen the first symbol, asterisk,

in our deep dive session.

Lets see the remaining ones now.

So that's it for this session, and lets jump on to the next regex symbol from the basic set.
