### OLTP

### What is Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)

-   designed to handle large volumes of short, atomic transactions in real-time.
-   Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) is a class of systems that manage transaction-oriented applications, primarily for data entry and retrieval.
-   Designed to handle high volumes of simple, short transactions, such as inserting, updating, and deleting records in a database.
-   Used when real-time processing and data integrity are critical.
-   Popular OLTP Systems include Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, IBM Db2, SAP HANA, Amazon Aurora

### Why OLTP?

-   **Improved Efficiency**: OLTP systems enable organizations to process large volumes of transactions quickly and accurately, improving overall operational efficiency.
-   **Increased Data Accuracy**: By adhering to ACID properties, OLTP systems ensure that data remains consistent and accurate even in the face of hardware failures, power outages, or other system disruptions.
-   **Real-time Decision-making**: With up-to-date information readily available, organizations can make real-time decisions based on accurate data, leading to better business outcomes.
-   **Enhanced Customer Experience**: Fast and reliable transaction processing contributes to a positive customer experience, which can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
-   **Scalability**: OLTP systems are designed to handle high transaction volumes, making them a scalable solution for growing businesses.

### Core Features

-   **High Concurrency**: Designed to handle a large number of concurrent users and transactions, ensuring that the system remains responsive even under heavy load.
-   **ACID Compliance**: Adhere to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties, which ensure that transactions are processed reliably and that the database remains in a consistent state.
-   **Real-time Processing**: Process transactions in real-time, allowing users to access up-to-date information and make data-driven decisions quickly.
-   **Data Integrity**: Techniques i.e. referential integrity constraints and triggers, are used to maintain data consistency and prevent data corruption.
-   **Optimized for Simple Transactions**: Optimized for handling simple, short transactions rather than complex, long-running analytical queries.
-   **Backup and Recovery**: To protect valuable data, OLTP systems incorporate robust backup and recovery mechanisms that enable quick recovery in the event of system failures or data loss.
