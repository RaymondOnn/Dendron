## What is Connection pooling

- Creating a pool of pre-initialized database connections that can be efficiently shared among multiple clients.
- This eliminates the need to establish new connections from scratch for every database operation.
- Minimizes the overhead of creating and closing database connections, can significantly improve response times and reduce resource consumption.

### Benefits of Connection Pooling

```diff
+ Performance: 
Reusing connections instead of repeatedly opening and closing them significantly enhances performance by reducing overhead.

+ Resource Management: 
Pooled connections ensure the judicious use of database resources, mitigating the risk of resource depletion.

+ Scalability: 
Connection pooling is indispensable for managing high-traffic scenarios, preventing the database server from being overwhelmed.
```

### Implementation

#### Step 1: Setting Up Connection Pooling (via `SQLAlchemy`)

``` py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.pool import QueuePool

# Create a connection pool
engine = create_engine('database://user:pass@host/db', poolclass=QueuePool)
```

#### Step: Connection Pool Config

```py
engine = create_engine('database://user:pass@host/db', pool_size=5, max_overflow=10)
```

#### Step: Establishing and Releasing Connections

```py
connection = engine.connect()  # Acquire connection from the pool
# ... perform database operations ...
connection.close()  # Release the connection back to the pool
```

#### Step: Handling Pool Size and Timeouts

``` oy
# Wait for a connection to be available in the pool
with engine.connect() as connection:
    # ... perform database operations ...
```

### An Example

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>without connection pooling</th>
    <th>with connection pooling</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>

``` py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from time import time

# Create an SQLite in-memory test database
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')

# Define a simple User model and create tables
# (Code for creating User model and tables here)
# Time the execution without connection pooling
start_time = time()
# Perform 1000 database queries without connection pooling
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
for _ in range(1000):
    session = Session()
    users = session.query(User).filter(User.id < 10).all()
    session.close()
end_time = time()
execution_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Time taken without connection pooling: {execution_time:.4f} seconds")
```

</td>
<td>

``` py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.pool import QueuePool
from time import time

# Create an SQLite in-memory test database with connection pooling
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:', poolclass=QueuePool)
# Define a simple User model and create tables
# (Code for creating User model and tables here)
# Time the execution with connection pooling
start_time = time()
# Perform 1000 database queries with connection pooling
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
for _ in range(1000):
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        users = connection.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id < 10').fetchall()
end_time = time()
execution_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Time taken with connection pooling: {execution_time:.4f} seconds")
```

</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Best Practices

- Tailor the pool size to your applicationâ€™s needs and database capacity.
- Implement graceful exception handling for connection errors and failures.
- Continuously monitor and fine-tune connection pool settings as your application evolves.
