Hello and welcome to this session.

Under POSIX standards, regular expressions are divided into 2 sets - The basic set and the extended set.

We looked at the basic set in the previous module. In the current module, we will cover the extended set.

Just like the basic set, the extended set also comes with a set of symbols, each one having a specific meaning and interpretation.

We will take these symbols one by one,

and see examples,

and hands-on sessions to study each of them thoroughly.

So that's it for this session, and lets jump on to the next regex symbol from the extended set.
