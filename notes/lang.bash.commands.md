##### [`curl`](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/curl-command)
- curl (short for "Client URL") is a command line tool that enables data transfer over various network protocols. 
- It communicates with a web or application server by specifying a relevant URL and the data that need to be sent or received.
- curl is powered by libcurl, a portable client-side URL transfer library. You can use it directly on the command line or include it in a script. 
- The most common use cases for curl are:
  - Downloading files from the internet
  - Endpoint testing
  - Debugging
  - Error logging
