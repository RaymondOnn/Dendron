Hello and welcome to this session.

In this module, we are going to explore the find and replace functionality using regex.

So far we were writing regular expressions which matched patterns and selected some

strings and excluded some others , from an input file.

Here we are going to do something different.

We are going to replace some parts of the string, or maybe the whole string itself.

in the very first step we understand the requirements

What part of the string needs to be replaced?

And what should be the replacement?

In the next step, we represent the search patterns using regex.

We will identify patterns that need to undergo replacement, then we will enclose the pattern(s) that needs to be replaced

with parentheses to segregate them into what are called capture groups.

The concept of capture groups will be clear when we go through the examples coming up soon.

Next we will come up with the substitution string

and get the replacement done for the captured pattern groups.

In the last step, we will use a regex engine to implement our find and replacement.

That's it for this session, and lets move on to the first example

using regex find and replace.
