The perfect data engineering portfolio project has the following things: 

- a data modeling diagram 
This shows you know how to build usable data tables. 

- a live visualization people can view from the web 
This is probably the thing people will look at and share. Without this front end, it’s much harder to wow people 

- a GitHub repo with data quality checks, fully functioning DAG code 
This shows you’re a high-caliber engineer who cares about quality, deploying to production and version control 

- a list of problems the pipeline is trying to solve 
This shows you aren’t just building pipelines for the fun of it but to provide value and solve problems!
