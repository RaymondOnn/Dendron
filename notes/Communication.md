Video: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkPfdR80u_8&list=PLwLhCsXo_YKO2bFzbLOhckAzpBS37FC6S&index=1&ab_channel=VickyZhao%5BBEEAMP%5D)

### Start with the Goal
- **What do we want people to do?**
- What does this impact others and what do you like them to do?

### Ethos: Credibility / Trust
- **What do I want my audience to know about me?**
- What are your audience interested in?
- Why are you talking about this?
  - Draw on your expertise / values / experience on why you are sharing this idea
  - What can they know about me to be receptive / open to this idea?

### Logos: Logic / Reason
- **What do I want people to know about the topic?**
- For e.g. the facts, the examples

### Pathos: Emotion
- **How do I want people to feel?**
- What do this information mean to them?
  - Does this help me survive and thrive?
  - I want to live happily and comfortably!

## How to articulate your thoughts and spread your ideas

### What makes your ideas interesting?
- Academic proposals of new, novel ideas don't tend to get funding as much as those ideas that are just building on something familiar i.e. a new twist on something that already exists

### The 4-letter framework: M.A.Y.A.
- Most Advanced Yet Acceptable
  - Have to balance the surprise with familiarity
  - If your idea is NEW
    - Have to make the connection to an existing idea
    - e.g. Airbnb -> Ebay for houses, Uber -> Airbnb for cars
    - Do not explain what this new thing is after giving context. What you want to do is to spark curiousity!!
  - if your idea is FAMILIAR
    - Here, you want to inject SURPRISE by focusing on the novel features. Context now is boring.
    - Focus on ASPIRATION: Why come out with a new way of looking at things? To keep things fresh, to improve lives to improve that old idea
    - Combine it with an element of SURPRISE: How does this impact them?

### Another 4-letter framework: A.I.D.A.
- Attention, Interest, Desire, Action
  - If idea is NEW
    - Attention -> Familiar (yet acceptable)
    - Interest -> M.A.Y.A.
    - Desire -> New (Most Advanced)
    - Action
  - if idea is FAMILAR
    - Attention -> New (Most Advanced) 
    - Interest -> Familiar (yet acceptable) 
    - Desire -> New (Most Advanced)
    - Action

## Getting to the point

### Think in comparisons
- Sometimes, we ramble because the point itself is not impactful
- By showing, you highlight the important details
- It is what they will feel after knowing this information that is key
- For e.g "Your home, as you imagine it" vs "Your home, like you've never imagined"

### Think in direction

- Sometimes, we ramble because we lack direction
- Visuals can help convey information across

### Think in visuals

- visuals help you remember information better!

## How to organize your thoughts

### 1. Find a quote

- Quotes are consise, impactful and straight to the point
- Through quotes, you align yourself with experts or people the other party trusts.
  - This helps establishing your credibility
  - Puts you in a positive position where the other party is open and willing to listen to what you have to say
- Quotes anchor your points
  - For others, you pre-empts them up on the points you like to make
  - It also helps you transition into your main points

### 2. Use intentional visuals (intended to show change / contrast)

- Humans process visuals much faster (than words)
- Visuals help you remember what you want to say

### 3. End with a simple action

- Actions needs to be simple. Humans generally want to conserve energy.
- for e.g. for climate change, bring your own bag when buying groceries
- Actions help you leverage on consistency bias. As people continue to do what you have suggested, they are likely to continue doing so
- These actions then create chances to recall the points you have made.

## [How to think fast and talk smart under pressure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xI5X4hd39o&list=PLwLhCsXo_YKO2bFzbLOhckAzpBS37FC6S&index=17&ab_channel=VickyZhao%5BBEEAMP%5D)

### Steer, Don't Follow

- The high pressure situation is created by someone taking control, which introduces uncertainty since you don't know what they will ask
- Know that you have the choice to steer the conversation back to the points you like to make
- You can determine what point you want to focus on 
- Ask yourself if the question is relevant
- if you get stuck, "Let me get back to you."
